# CSS ANIMATIONS!!!!!

You know a little bit how to move stuff around with JavaScript.... now let's learn how to make it move around with CSS!!!

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how traditional hand-drawn keyframe animation and CSS animation relate
- Use the `transition` property to animate elements
- Use the `transform` property to change elements
- Recognize the different values for the `transform` property and see what they do
- Recognize the parts of keyframe syntax
- Analyze a description of an animation and understand at a high level what steps would be needed to reproduce it

## Transitions Redux

- Go back over the parts of the transition property -- duration, which one, ease, etc.
- A circle that falls on hover using a transition value
- What if we wanted it to bounce?

## Keyframes & the `animation` property

- Keyframes as an animation concept
- Keyframe syntax
- `animation` property syntax -- diagram on board
- putting it all together -- we code a bouncing circle together & play around with the different animation property values (reverse, repeat, time, etc.)

# Lab 1

- Work in groups
- Each group gets an index card with a series of keyframes drawn on it
- They get some kind of starter CSS and have to write the animation
- will include: applying syntax, looking up documentation
- Include links to some documentation

## Transforms

- Go over the different families of transform properties
    - translate
    - scale
    - rotate
    - skew
- concept: when you rotate an element, everything inside the element also rotates
- we do together:
    - rotate a box with text in it first
    - rotate a box with a circle in it
    - rotate multiple boxes
    - hey look, we built a solar system

# Lab 2

- They try to add one or two planets to the solar system
