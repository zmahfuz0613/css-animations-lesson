# CSS ANIMATIONS!!!!!

You know a little bit how to move stuff around with JavaScript.... now let's learn how to make it move around with CSS!!!

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how traditional hand-drawn keyframe animation and CSS animation relate
- Use the `animation` property to animate elements
- Use the `transform` property to change elements
- Recognize the different values for the `transform` property and see what they do
- Recognize the parts of keyframe syntax
- Analyze a description of an animation and understand at a high level what steps would be needed to reproduce it

## Transitions Redux

**Transitions** let us tell the browser how to change a property over time. You'll commonly see the `transition` property used on `:hover` and `:focus` states, as we talked about last week.

However, with `:hover` and `:focus`, we were mostly changing things like background color, font color, etc. Transition can be used with many more properties.

### âœ¨ Follow along in this [Codepen](http://codepen.io/jlr7245/pen/zZVJyL?editors=1100)!!

#### ðŸ“š For reference:

The `transition` property is shorthand for a number of other properties -- like `border` is shorthand for `border-color`, `border-width`, etc. The syntax goes like this:

```css
transition: property duration timing-function delay;
/* property: which property the transition effect is for
   duration: how many seconds or milliseconds the transition effect takes
   timing-function: specifies the "speed curve" of the transition effect
   delay: defines with the transition effect will start */
```

So, if we were trying to write a transition rule that smoothly changes the background color over 2 seconds starting 1s after the action that causes the transition, we'd write:

```css
transition: background-color 2s ease 1s;
```

### Not all properties are "transitionable" or "animatable". 

Here's a table of the most common animatable & non-animatable properties. (It's not an exhaustive list; head over to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_animatable.asp) for the full list.)

| Animatiable                                                  | Not animatable                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `background-color`, `background-position`, `background-size` | `background-image`, `background-blend-mode` |
| `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`                             | `position`                                  |
| `height`, `width`, `min-height`, `min-width`                 | -                                           |
| `margin`, `border`, `padding`                                | `box-sizing`, `border-image`                |
| `opacity`, `visibility`                                      | `display`                                   |
| most text & font properties                                  | `font-family`                               |
| -                                                            | `float`, `clear`                            |


### Transitions are pretty cool.

But they have some limitations, at least in the way we're using them here. What if we don't want to have to hover over the circle to get it to move? What if it should move when the page loads? We could feasably force that with JavaScript and a `setTimeout`, but that puts us back in the world of DOM manipulation. There's an easier way...

## Keyframes & the `animation` property

### What is a "keyframe"?

![keyframes example](./assets/keyframes.jpg)

Keyframes are a common animation concept, usually found in hand-drawn animation. In the above image, the figures in grey are **keyframes** - they define the starting, ending, or middle point of a smooth transition. The other drawings are **inbetweens** - they don't have to be drawn on a storyboard, because the animator can assume what they will look like without a visual reference.

In web-based animations, keyframes work the same way - they represent the begining, ending, or midpoint state of the element being animated. However, our inbetweens will be generated by code, instead of being filled in by hand later.

The `transition` property allows us to define a beginning and end point for a state change. However, sometimes you'll want to have an element move through multiple states during an animation. That's where the CSS keyframes rule comes in.



# Lab 1

- Work in groups
- Each group gets an index card with a series of keyframes drawn on it
- They get some kind of starter CSS and have to write the animation
- will include: applying syntax, looking up documentation
- Include links to some documentation

## Transforms

- Go over the different families of transform properties
    - translate
    - scale
    - rotate
    - skew
- concept: when you rotate an element, everything inside the element also rotates
- we do together:
    - rotate a box with text in it first
    - rotate a box with a circle in it
    - rotate multiple boxes
    - hey look, we built a solar system

# Lab 2

- They try to add one or two planets to the solar system
